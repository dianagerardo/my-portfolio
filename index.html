            <!--This is the about me section-->
            <p>Use the very first line of your “About Me” page to simply tell visitors who you are. Think about how you would introduce yourself to someone who’s asked what you do, and just go from there. Make sure you mention the city you’re based in</p>
            <p>If you’d like your “About Me” page to include a CV, your best bet is to simplify and shorten it up a lot. Your biography should be descriptive, but not too long.</p>
            <p>If you want to keep your “About Me” page more brief and to-the-point, just choose a few interesting projects or jobs to mention. Including links to past work is a good way to let visitors find out more.</p>
            <p>Are you a dog owner? Do you like to paint in your spare time? Do you have a passion for skiing? It may seem unprofessional to include little details like these, but a biography page that only lists work-related information about you isn’t offering a complete introduction</p>
